The TurboETH Web3 App template is both **opinionated** and **minimalist**. It comes equipped with essential boilerplate code, a robust set of common developer tools, and unstyled components, all crafted with the intention of facilitating the development of web apps on an Internet scale.

## [TurboETH CLI](/getting-started/cli)
<img src='/assets/cli/turbo-eth-cli.png' />
The TurboETH CLI is the recommended way to get started. With the CLI, you can select from a range of integrations, providers, and networks to kickstart your project.

Get started with the TurboETH CLI by running the following command in your terminal:
```bash
pnpm create turbo-eth@latest
```

## Integrations
TurboETH provides a suite of integrations with diverse protocols and applications, intended to significantly expedite the development process.

These integrations reside in standalone folders and pages, granting you the flexibility to add or remove them from your project as needed. Designed with modularity at their core, they can be used in any combination that suits your requirements.

The integrations are organized into the following categories:

### [üß± Core Integrations](/integration/core/introduction)
Core integrations are an essential part of the TurboETH template. They cannot be removed from the project and are intended to be used in every app.

### [‚õìÔ∏è Smart Contract Integrations](/integration/smart-contract/introduction)
Smart contract integrations are specifically designed to streamline the interaction with smart contracts. This is accomplished using custom hooks generated by the [Wagmi CLI](/getting-started/wagmi-cli), paired with purpose-built components and hooks.

## Roadmap

Right now TurboETH is a Web3 App Template built using Next.js, RainbowKit, SIWE, Disco, and Etherscan.

In the future TurboETH will be an ‚ùñ Open Source Web3 Build System that supercharges developers with decentralized and distributed primitives: blockchains, authentication, identity, storage, and access controls.

Giving all developers (Web2 + Web3) new superpowers.
