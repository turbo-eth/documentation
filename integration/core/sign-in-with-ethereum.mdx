description: "Account Authentication"
---

[Sign-In with Ethereum](https://login.xyz) is a new form of authentication that enables users to control their digital identity with their Ethereum account and ENS profile instead of relying on a traditional intermediary.
Already used throughout web3, this is an effort to standardize the method with best practices and to make it easier for web2 services to adopt it.
