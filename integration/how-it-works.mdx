## Understanding Integrations

The power of TurboETH lies in its modular integration architecture. This design allows developers to customize, interchange, and upgrade application components as needed. Here's a deeper look at how they work:

### Core Concepts

**Isolation**: Each integration is independent, mitigating risks associated with changes to other parts of the codebase.

**Reusability**: Integrations can be reused across projects or shared within the community, promoting collaborative development.

**Scalability**: As your needs grow, you can easily scale your application by incorporating additional integrations.

### How Do They Work?

#### Initialization
Integrations are designed for effortless setup and teardown. They can be added or removed by simply copying their corresponding core and `api` folders and installing the required dependencies. For streamlined integration setup when creating a new project, consider using the [TurboETH CLI](/getting-started/cli), which automates the selection and configuration process.

#### Interaction
Depending on the integration type, the interaction varies. For instance, smart contract integrations use custom hooks, while API integrations provide interfaces to external APIs.

#### Composition
You can combine integrations to build robust, scalable Web3 applications. An application could use an API integration to fetch data, a smart contract integration to interact with on-chain contracts, and an SDK integration to leverage third-party SDKs.

In summary, TurboETH's integrations streamline development, reduce redundancy, and promote reusability, enhancing the developer experience.

### Core Integrations
Core integrations are an essential part of the TurboETH template. They cannot be removed from the project and are intended to be used in every app.

### [‚õìÔ∏è Smart Contract Integrations](/integration/smart-contract/introduction)
Smart contract integrations are specifically designed to streamline the interaction with smart contracts. This is accomplished using custom hooks generated by the [Wagmi CLI](/getting-started/wagmi-cli), paired with purpose-built components and hooks.
